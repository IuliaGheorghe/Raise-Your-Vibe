                <h1>Will Smith</h1>
                <h2>Pursuit of Happiness</h2>
                <p>
                    Considered one of the best motivational speeches, this famous motivational speech from the 2006 film, Pursuit of Happyness, features Will Smith and his son playing basketball. <br><br>
                    At the start of the clip, you’ll see Smith’s son (his actual son, Jaden Smith) playing around with a basketball, and he shouts out, “I’m going pro!” <br><br>
                    After hearing this, Smith decides to try and level his son’s expectations, mentioning that he himself never really excelled at basketball, so his son shouldn’t expect to either. <br><br>
                    His son is visibly disappointed by this comment, and Smith notices this. <br><br>
                    Smith then proclaims: <b>“don’t ever let somebody tell you that you can’t do something, not even me.”</b> <br><br>
                    <b>“You got a dream, you gotta protect it. You want something, go get it. Period.”</b> <br><br>
                    This motivational speech is a special one. Even though both Will and Jaden Smith are acting, they’re still father and son, and you can see how this scene reflects their own family dynamic. <br><br>
                    It’s a short motivational speech, but it’s one of the best motivational speeches of all time, in our opinion. <br>

                <h1>Al Pacino </h1>
                <h2>Any Given Sunday</h2>
                <p>
                    This famous motivational speech really gets your blood flowing – perfect for watching before you tackle a difficult day. <br><br>

                    The motivational speech revolves around the idea of inches being so important in American Football, even if we have the tendency to overlook them. <br><br>

                    He talks about the different ways that his team can gain advantages over their opponents, even if it’s only an inch at a time. <br><br>

                    He proclaims: <b>“when we add up all those inches, that’s what makes the difference between winning and losing”</b>. <br><br>

                    This point is applicable throughout life, too – it’s the people who go the extra mile who tend to find success more often than not. <br><br>

                    And sometimes, you won’t notice it at first, but like Pacino mentions, it’s the sum of all the small parts which lead you to victory.

                <h1>Steve Jobs </h1>
                <h2>2005 Stanford Commencement Speech</h2>
                <p>
                    In his 2005 Stanford commencement speech, the former Apple CEO dives deep into his own journey as an entrepreneur, and he speaks openly about the issues that he’s faced along the way and how he overcame them. <br><br>

                    During this classic motivational speech, Jobs talks about how he was actually a college dropout and that this was one of the most important times of his life. <br><br>

                    Why? <br><br>

                    He mentioned that he dropped out of college to take classes that he was truly interested in, rather than studying topics he wasn’t deeply passionate about. <br><br>

                    One of those classes that he took up after dropping out was calligraphy. He was so compelled by the high standard of handwriting. <br><br>

                    To many, this might seem like a strange choice, but he connects the experience that he gained from that class to the font choices that he installed on Apple computers. <br><br>

                    If Jobs had never taken that calligraphy class, he wouldn’t have cared so much about a seemingly small detail, like fonts, but Apple was the first company to add different typefaces to their operating systems. <br><br>

                    He goes on to say: <b>“You can’t connect the dots if you’re looking forward, you can only do it looking backwards. So, you need to keep moving forward and hope that the dots align somehow.”</b> <br><br>

                    The key message from this famous motivational speech is that we’re always learning. We’re always growing and finding out new information. It’s all about what we choose to do with that information that really defines us. <br><br>

                    As Jobs said: <b>“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.”</b>

                <h1>Matthew McConaughey </h1>
                <h2>University of Houston Speech</h2>
                <p>
                    The Oscar-winning actor delivers some very pertinent points during his speech, but the one that stuck out for me was how he spoke of joy being a “constant approach”. <br><br>

                    McConaughey said: <b>“Joy is always in process, it’s always under construction.”</b> <br><br>

                    He spoke of how he was previously judging his success on metrics that he thought were important to him, like the number of academy awards he won, or the amount of money his films grossed. <br><br>

                    But, it was only when he decided to focus on the whole process of creating a film, and enjoying every aspect of it, that he found true success in those metrics. <br><br>

                    It turned out that, when he took everything one step at a time, and truly enjoyed his craft, he found that things just fell into place. <br><br>

                    <b>“Define success for yourself.”</b> <br><br>

                    Find what you want to achieve, and enjoy the entire journey – not just the high points, but the lows too. <br><br>

                    Matthew McConaughey ended up delivering one of the best motivational speeches from the past few years. <br><br>

                <h1>Ed Shereen </h1>
                <h2>Being Weird is a Wonderful Thing</h2>
                <p>
                    At the 9th Annual American Institute for Stuttering Benefit Gala, Sheeran talked about how Eminem helped him overcome his speech impediment. <br><br>

                    Sheeran admits to being a “very, very weird child” with a birthmark on his face, large glasses, and no eardrum on one side of his head. He says that “stuttering was actually the least of my problems when I went to school,” but he found it extremely difficult. <br><br>

                    Sheeran notes that not being able to express himself in the right way was his biggest concern with his stutter. However, when his dad bought him an Eminem CD when he was young. Listening to it helped him to learn how to speak fast and accomplish his stutter. <br><br>

                    Ed’s insights are a great source of inspiration for entrepreneurs learning how to deal with the stress of public speaking and believing in themselves. <br><br>

                    Now, Ed believes that <b>“being weird is a wonderful thing”</b>. He asks us to <b>“embrace yourself, embrace your quirks, and embrace your weirdness.”</b> <br><br>
